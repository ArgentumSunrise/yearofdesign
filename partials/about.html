    <h1 class='museo-slab'>Hi! I'm Colter.</h1>
    <p class='museo'>And this is my Year of Design homepage, a project that came about after I decided I wanted to make cool stuff and share it with random strangers on the Internet (and after I saw <a target='_blank' href='http://365cons.com'>this</a> awesome icon diary). Every day for a year, I'll be posting a new design I'm working on, be it print design or web design or just something nice I wanted to show you. Let me know what you think, and if you really like my stuff, follow me and I'll show you more of it. Thanks!</p>
